**Summary:** Fixed Biome 2.x configuration

## Session 1: Biome Config Fix

**Status:** Complete

### What was done

- Fixed `biome.json` configuration error that was blocking pre-commit hook
- Migrated from deprecated `files.ignore` syntax to Biome 2.x `files.includes` syntax

### Files changed

- `biome.json` - Replaced `files.ignore` array with `files.includes` using `!!` prefix for complete exclusion

### Decisions

- **Decision:** Use `!!` prefix (double exclamation) for ignored paths
  - **Context:** Biome 2.0 removed `files.ignore` key entirely
  - **Rationale:** `!!` completely excludes paths from all Biome operations (lint, format, type indexing). Single `!` would still allow type inference which isn't needed for node_modules/dist folders.

### Technical details

Old syntax (Biome 1.x):
```json
"files": {
  "ignore": ["node_modules", "dist"]
}
```

New syntax (Biome 2.x):
```json
"files": {
  "includes": ["**", "!!node_modules", "!!dist"]
}
```

### Next steps

- [ ] Verify pre-commit hook passes with staged changes
